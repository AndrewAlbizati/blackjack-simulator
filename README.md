# Blackjack Simulator

This program is used to simulate multiple Blackjack games and track the statistics. This program tracks:

- Games simulated
- Time elapsed

- Wins
- Losses
- Pushes

- Busts
- Dealer busts

- Value wins
- Value losses

- Player Blackjacks
- Dealer Blackjacks

- Hits
- Stands
- Doubles
- Splits

- Final amount won

Each game can be bet on by adjusting the `betPerRound` variable,
and the total amount of games simulated can be changed be modifying the `simulations` variable.

## Blackjack Simulator Rules
1. Dealer stands on all 17s
2. Blackjacks pay 3 to 2
3. If the dealer is dealt a Blackjack with the Ace showing, the game ends (even if the player is dealt a Blackjack)
